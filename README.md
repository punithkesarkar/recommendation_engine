Objective: In order to determine which articles to show to each user, I perform 
a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform.

# Files
- Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook code containing all the analysis done
- Recommendations_with_IBM.html - summary output of the jupter notebook in html format
- top_10.p, top_20.p, top_5.p and user_item_matrix.p - these are the results of the matrix
- articles_community.csv and user-item-interactions.csv - these files are to be imported
